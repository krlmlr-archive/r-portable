The **knitr** package [@R-knitr] is an alternative tool to Sweave based on a
different design with more features. This document is not an introduction,
but only serves as a placeholder to guide you to the real manuals, which are
available on the package website <http://yihui.name/knitr>^[e.g. the [main
manual](http://bit.ly/117OLVl) and the [graphics
manual](http://bit.ly/114GNdP)], and remember to read the help pages of
functions in this package. There is a book [@xie2013] for this package, but
it may not be useful to those who prefer digging out information on the web.

Anyway, here is a code chunk that shows you can compile vignettes with
**knitr** as well using R 3.0.x, which supports non-Sweave vignettes:

```{r show-off}
rnorm(5)
df=data.frame(y=rnorm(100), x=1:100)
summary(lm(y~x, data=df))
```
