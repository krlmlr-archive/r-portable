Maintainer: Yihui Xie <xie@yihui.name>
Description: This package provides a function tidy_source() to format R source
    code. Spaces and indent will be added to the code automatically, and
    comments will be preserved under certain conditions, so that R code will be
    more human-readable and tidy. There is also a Shiny app as a user interface
    in this package (see tidy_app()).
Suggests: codetools, shiny, testit, knitr
