Description: Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH
    pubkey parsers. Supports RSA, DSA and NIST curves P-256, P-384 and P-521.
    Cryptographic signatures can either be created and verified manually or via x509
    certificates. AES block cipher is used in CBC mode for symmetric encryption; RSA
    for asymmetric (public key) encryption. High-level envelope functions combine
    RSA and AES for encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key
    generators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure
    random number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually performing
    crypto calculations on large multibyte integers.
