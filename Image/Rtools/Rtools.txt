                      Rtools Collection 3.3.0.1958

This is the Rtools.txt file, which will be installed in the main
Rtools directory. See also the README.txt file there, which describes
the origin of some of the tools. The tools installed in the
Rtools\gcc492_32, and Rtools\gcc492_64 directories 
are from the MinGW-w64 distribution.  
 

                                CYGWIN
			  
Some of the R tools use the Cygwin DLLs, which are included.  If you
already have Cygwin installed, you should not install these (but see
"EXISTING CYGWIN INSTALLATIONS" below).

                           REMAINING TASKS

This installer doesn't install all of the tools necessary to build R
or R packages, because of license or size limitations.  The remaining
tools are all available online (at no charge) as described below.

TO BUILD R PACKAGES, you may optionally want item 1 below
(LaTeX).

TO BUILD R, you do need item 1, and item 2 (Inno Setup) is optional if you
would like to build the installer.

As of R 3.2.0, the manuals are optional.  To build them you will need
item 3 below. 

The Rtools installer will optionally edit your PATH variable as follows:

PATH=c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\gcc-4.6.3\bin;<others>

(where you will substitute appropriate directories for the ones listed
above, but please keep the path in the same order as shown. LaTeX and
R itself should be installed among the "others".)

                           REMAINING ITEMS

1. You may install LaTeX, available from

  http://www.miktex.org
  
LaTeX is used to build .pdf forms of documentation.
  
2. You need the Inno Setup installer, available from

  http://www.innosetup.com
  
to build the R installer.

3. You will need Perl, e.g. from

  http://strawberryperl.com/
  
to build the manuals.

                               VERSIONS
			
This installer includes a multilib build of gcc 4.6.3, compiled by
Brian Ripley.  Experimental builds of gcc 4.9.2 by Duncan Murdoch 
are not included, but are available for download from CRAN in the
bin/windows/Rtools/scripts directory.

The Cygwin tools and DLLs were updated on November 19, 2013.  They are 
32 bit versions taken from
    
    base-cygwin 3.3-1
    coreutils 8.23-4
    cygwin 1.7.33-1
    diffutils 3.3-2
    findutils 4.5.12-1
    gawk 4.1.1-1
    grep 2.21-1
    gzip 1.6-1
    texinfo 4.13 (used for R 3.1.x and earlier) and 5.2 (used for R 3.2.x and later).
    
    
Tcl/Tk is version 8.5.8.

tar is a locally modified version of tar version 1.21.

    
    

                    EXISTING CYGWIN INSTALLATIONS
		
If you already have a full 32 bit Cygwin installation, then you should not
install our Cygwin DLLs in the Rtools/bin directory.  You should make
sure your existing cygwin/bin directory is on the path (*after* all
the other entries listed above) and use the DLLs from there.

However, this may not work if your Cygwin installation is too old.  In
that case the Rtools utilities will fail to run.  To fix this, you
should update the Cygwin installation, or (with great care!) replace
the DLLs with the ones from the Rtools distribution.  Be very careful,
because if you have incompatible DLLs, your Cygwin tools will stop
working.
